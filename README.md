# Public Journal Editor

### Description
This website allows users to login and create drafts of articles. The user can create, view, edit, and delete posts when logged
into their account. The user can then post articles to be viewed publicly and can remove posts from public viewing. If a public
post is modified or deleted by the user, the article changes in public viewing as well.

Usernames are not case sensitive, as this allows users to use unique email addresses for usernames.

This project was created for Oregon State University's **CS 290 Final Project**
